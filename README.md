## ü§ñ How the Chatbot Works

The chatbot is the heart of this platform, assisting users in every step of the ticket booking process. Here's how it works:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users interact with the chatbot through a text-based interface.
   - Example: "Book a ticket for tomorrow" or "Check available slots."

2. **AI Processing**:
   - The chatbot processes user input using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
   - It understands the intent and provides relevant responses.

3. **Ticket Booking**:
   - Users can book tickets by following prompts provided by the chatbot.
   - Example:
     - Chatbot: "When would you like to visit?"
     - User: "Tomorrow at 10 AM."
     - Chatbot: "Great! Please confirm your details."

4. **Confirmation**:
   - After completing the booking, the chatbot sends a confirmation message with booking details.
